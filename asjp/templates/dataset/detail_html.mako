    The ASJP project aims at achieving a computerized lexicostatistical analysis of ideally all the worldâ€™s languages.
</p>
<p>
The two main purposes are to provide a classification of all languages by a single, consistent and objective (if perhaps not ideal) method and to perform various statistical analyses regarding the historical and areal behavior of lexical items.
